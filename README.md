# Overview
This repository is a collection of my Dynamics AX 365 classes, methods, functions and other code snippets that might be useful for re-using 
code or to remind or educate on how to solve a specific request. 

# Structure
- **Models** - Custom classes which contains general (usually static) methods which is intended for a single specific table/class/process.
- **Services** - Custom classes which performs a single, specific process.
- **TSQL** - Custom T-SQL code or scripts which can be used with D365

## Test / ATL
- **Command** - Very similar to a service class, a class that performs a single specific process for Unit-/Process-/e2e test.

## Code language
All classes are written in X++
